### Play Ground

This folder will serve as a practice playground to come up with folder structure and CMake build script to automate FPGA workflow from common verilog source to multiple FPGA boards.

### Points to explore

- assertion for test bench
- use of library in fpga project
- how are verilog modules resolution works
- constraints file component IO, IOPORT etc
- what is tangnano20K sdc file (gowin projects)

### How to use this build system
